## User Story
---
Game secrets is an application to help even the most frustrated gamers level up...LITERALLY!  Users will be able to create a personal profile to post gamer questions and pass on gaming secrets.  The user will access the search bar to search for the title of the game they are playing.  Once the search has been completed the application will render the fetched information to the search page.  The user will be presented with a range of information including secret information to help get to the next levels.

## Description
---
The project has been designed to use an API fetch to recieve and render user input information specific to the gaming title.  The user has the ability to make comments, delete comments and upload images/media to their profile.

- AS A USER I want to be able to log-in/sign up
- AS A USER I want ro be able to search for a specific game title and be presented with everything related to my search
- AS A USER I should be able to make posts and upload pictures/screenshots if necessary
- AS A USER I want to be able to message other users if I have further questions


## Process
---
We used Mongo DB to setup the server for our app, Express.js as the middleware and React JS as the template rendering engine for this app.
